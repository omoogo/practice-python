# Title: Divisors

# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
# (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a
# divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)
